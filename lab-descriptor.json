  "introduction": "The Basic Electrical Science Virtual Lab is designed to provide students with a fundamental understanding of electrical concepts through interactive virtual experiments. This lab serves as a foundation for students pursuing engineering, physics, and related technical disciplines. It enables learners to explore electrical theories, circuit analysis, and component behavior in a simulated environment, eliminating the need for physical hardware while maintaining the hands-on experience of practical learning.<br>The virtual lab covers key topics such as Ohm’s Law, Kirchhoff’s Laws, AC/DC circuits, electrical measurements, and power calculations. Through simulations, students can design and analyse circuits, measure voltage, current, and resistance, and understand real-world electrical applications. This interactive platform enhances conceptual understanding, improves problem-solving skills, and bridges the gap between theory and practical application.By leveraging the advantages of virtual labs, students can conduct experiments anytime and anywhere, promoting flexible and self-paced learning. The Basic Electrical Science Virtual Lab aims to provide an immersive, engaging, and efficient learning experience, preparing students for more advanced studies in electrical engineering and related fields.",
